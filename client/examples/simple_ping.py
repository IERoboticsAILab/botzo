"""Simple Ping Example - Botzo SDK

This example demonstrates how to establish a serial connection with the Botzo
quadruped robot's microcontroller and verify connectivity using a ping command.

The example performs the following steps:
    1. Establishes serial connection to the MCU
    2. Sends a PING command
    3. Waits for ACK response (PONG)
    4. Cleanly disconnects

Hardware Requirements:
    - Botzo quadruped robot with MCU
    - USB-to-Serial adapter or direct USB connection
    - Proper serial drivers installed

Configuration:
    SERIAL_PORT: Serial port identifier
        - Linux/macOS: /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyACM0, /dev/cu.usbserial-*
        - Windows: COM3, COM4, etc.
    SERIAL_BAUD: Baud rate (must match MCU firmware configuration)
        - Default: 115200
        - Common: 9600, 115200, 921600

Expected Output:
    [Interface] INFO Connected to /dev/ttyUSB0:115200
    [example_simple_ping] INFO Sending PING to MCU
    [example_simple_ping] INFO Received PONG - Connection verified!
    [Interface] INFO Disconnected
    [example_simple_ping] INFO Disconnected successfully

Troubleshooting:
    - If connection fails: Check port name, ensure MCU is powered
    - If no PONG received: Verify baud rate matches firmware
    - Permission denied: Add user to dialout group (Linux) or check permissions

Usage:
    uv run examples/simple_ping.py

    # Or with Python directly
    python examples/simple_ping.py
