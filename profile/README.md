# Botzo Documentation

Welcome to the **Botzo Project** documentation. This project aims to develop an autonomous quadruped robot designed for navigating complex terrains, collecting data and samples, and interacting with its environment. Botzo combines a sleek, modern design with practical functionality to achieve this purpose.

## **Project Overview**

The Botzo robot is designed with practicality, focusing on autonomous mobility and environmental interaction. Our team is actively working through multiple development phases, each dedicated to a specific aspect of Botzoâ€™s design, hardware, and software.


## **Goals**

### Phase 1: Proposal and Circuit Design âœ…

In this initial phase, we researched and selected essential components, considering:
- **Processing**: Jetson/Pi4 options
- **Actuators**: Torque capacity
- **Power Supply**: Battery requirements and converters
- **Sensors**: For environmental awareness
- **Other Components**

With a projected runtime of ~18 minutes under max load, actual tests suggest closer to ~30 minutes of operation. For more details, refer to the [Canva Board Proposal](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGQqN2k1i4/RCJst_pNSHRcbE02HOKgEw/edit?utm_content=DAGQqN2k1i4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).

### Phase 2: Leg Design ðŸ”œ

Key steps include:
1. Fusion 360 Design
2. Integration of shock-absorbing dampers
3. Addition of ball bearings
4. Servo testing
5. Inverse Kinematics
6. Design of a testing rig for movement evaluation

Our leg design is inspired by a servo quadruped, focusing on optimized torque distribution and stability. More information can be found in the [Hackaday project reference](https://hackaday.io/project/171456-diy-hobby-servos-quadruped-robot/details).
