## 🌟 **Welcome to the Botzo Project!**

**Botzo** is an autonomous quadruped robot designed to Navigate and Interact with its environment 🌍

This project combines sleek design, cutting-edge technology, and practical functionality to redefine robotic mobility.

## 📚 **Project Overview**

Botzo's development is divided into multiple phases, each focusing on specific aspects of its design, hardware, and software. We're actively working through these stages to bring the robot to life!

We stand in the middle of a trade of between high quality software and hardware, with low cost and affordability.

**Botzo is aimed to be a strong platform for everyone to replicate under 500€**
