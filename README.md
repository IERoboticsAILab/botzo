# IMU_readings
Set up MPU6050 and read rotations and accellerations in each axes

## MPU6050

This sensor is an accellerometer gyroscope. It means it is able to read rotation (roll, pitch, yaw) and accelleration in each axes.

## Usage

After small calibration using build in scripts in `<MPU6050_light.h>` library we where able to test the reading with a simple project translating roll andle in to angles for the servo motor.
